Troubleshoot:
Error in installation with Scotch requires downloading Scotch separately ¨C into the same root directory folder as Specfem3d ¨C then copy the folders grt, tgt, man, and include, from the Specfem3d inbuilt (version provided with) Scotch to the user-downloaded scotch/build directory. Now, rerun the installation using the scotch partitioning code above.
