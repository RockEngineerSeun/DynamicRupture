# DynamicRupture
This repository contains data used in the paper "3D physics-based simulation of dynamic fault-slip rupture models and the radiated seismic waves impact on near-field stope", the code for the user-developed model (Fig. 1a), and its laboratory derived material properties are presented in the "createMesh.py" file. Additionally, the repository contains the data used for dynamic fault-rupture analyses based on the rate-and-state dependent friction and the linear slip-weakening friction laws. The linear slip-weakening friction law parameters are provided by the second SCEC Spontaneous Rupture Code-Validation Workshop[1,2] and the corresponding rate-and-state friction parameters are provided by Kaneko et al[3].
